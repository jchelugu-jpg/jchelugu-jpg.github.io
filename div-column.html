    <h2>CHRISTMAS</h2>
    <p>The reason why Christmas is my number one on top 5 holidays is because Christmas brings back happy memories along with the fact that the temperature is more cooled. Christmas just brings many cheers.</p>
    <hr style="width: 100%">
    <h2> NEW YEARS</h2>
    <p> New years is my second favorite holiday because is close to Christmas and also a time where I can refelct on the year that has passed, and rejoice for the year aheead of me for new beginings. </p>
    <hr style="width: 100%">
    <h2> INDEPENDENCE DAY</h2>
    <p> Independence day is in my top five as well only for the mere fact that ironically it's the day of my birthday. I do enjoy though its in the summer.</p>
    <hr style="width: 100%">
    <h2> THANKSGIVING</h2>
    <p> Thansgiving is fourth on my top five because I enjoy the time that I spend with my family and friends eating good food. We'll usually go out of town to visit with family friends or as a community we'll hold something for everyone. </p>
    <hr style="width: 100%">
    <h2 > VALENTINES DAY</h2>
    <p> Valentines Day isn't a major holiday for me but I have good memories from it from my dad and school. I enjoyed when we would have class parties and everyone would bring candy to share. My dad would get me flowers and everything else which makes the day special to me.</p>
