 <h1> THE BETTLE</h1>

<h2> External Morphology</h2>

<h2> Head</h3>
<p>The head of the bettle consists of mouthparts projecting forward or sometimes downturned. The eyes on the bettle are compound, the eyes are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline.    </h3>
<h2> Mouthparts</h2>
<p>The complex structure of the bettles mouth has several parts including an upper lip, a pair of powerful jaws for crushing food. A pair of more complex apendages are used for manipulating food and gathering liquids.</h3>
<h2> Thorax</h2>
<p>The middle, armored body section, located between the head and abdomen. This serves as the attachement point for all six legs and both pairs of wings. </p>
<h2> Prothrorax and Pterothorax</h2>
<p> The thorax is segmented into two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which is commonly seperated in other insect species.</p>
<h2> Legs</h2>
<p>The multisegmented legs end in two to five small segments called tarsi. Similar to many other insects, bettles have claws, usually one pair; on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg.</p>
<h2>Wings </h2>
<p>The forewings of beetles are not used for flight, but they form elytra which cover the hind part of the body and protect the hindwings. The elytra is usually a hard shell-like structure - this allows the hindwings to move for flight. </p>
<h2>Abdomen </h2>
<p> The abdomen of the bettle is the section behind the metathorax which is made up of a series of rings. The abdomen consits of holes each for breathing and respiration called a spiracle.</p>
