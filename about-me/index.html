            <section>
                <p> My name is Joy Cheluguy. I am a junior in high school at Jenks. I enjoy running, reading, and cleaning (as funny as that sounds). I was originally born in Eldoret, Kenya but then moved to the United states in my younger year.We often every summer go and visit family back home.</p>

                <p> After high school I plan to go to ORU here in Tulsa for my first four years of college. After wards I hope to enroll in a scholarship program and go start my Dental school over in California. I want to go in the Dentistry field primarly for the given fact of the satisfaction from cleaning and helping others find and feel the joy in their smile.</p>
