       <p> I would like to visit somewhere like Joshua Tree Arizona one day. I like the scenic aspect of the place and how isolated and peaceful the place is. The only thing that makes me nervous may be the fact it's in the middle of the desert not very close to the  main city or other people. I feel like such a place is great to unwind and just take eveything around in. </p>
