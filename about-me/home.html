    <h2> Eldoret, Kenya</h2>

        <p> This image is just a small portion of my homeplace in Eldoret, Kenya. As I had said on my main "About Me" homepage I was originally born in Kenya and moved to America when I was four. I only moved here with my immediete family but we often visit every summer. Going back feels like a refresher and I'm always wishing that the time was extended. I love Kenya because of the main fact that my whole family is there but also for enviornment and community. I now perementaly live in Jenks Oklahoma.</p>
